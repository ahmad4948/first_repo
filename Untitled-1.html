<p>Johann Carl Fridrich Gauss <i style="color :blue">(1777-23 february 1855)</i>was a German mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to many fields in mathematics and 
    science. Sometimes referred to as the <span style="color: blue"> Princeps mathematicorum</span> and "the greatest mathematician since antiiquity". Gauss had an exceptional influence in many fields 
    of mathematics and science, and is ranked amoung history's most influential mathematicians.

    <h1 style="color:blue ;">Biography</h1>
    Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick (Braunschweig), in the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (now part of Lower Saxony, Germany), to poor, 
    working-class parents. His mother was illiterate and never recorded the date of his birth, remembering only that he had been born on a Wednesday, eight days before the 
    Feast of the Ascension (which occurs 39 days after Easter). Gauss later solved this puzzle about his birthdate in the context of finding the date of Easter, deriving 
    methods to compute the date in both past and future years. He was christened and confirmed in a church near the school he attended as a child.

Gauss also made important contributions to number theory with his 1801 book<span></span> Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (Latin, Arithmetical Investigations), which, among other things, introduced the triple bar symbol ≡ for congruence and used it in a clean presentation of modular arithmetic, contained the first two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, developed the theories of binary and ternary quadratic forms, stated the class number problem for them, and showed that a regular heptadecagon (17-sided polygon) can be constructed with straightedge and compass. It appears that Gauss already knew the class number formula in 1801.[47]

In addition, he proved the following conjectured theorems:
</p>
<pre> 
    

    Fermat polygonal number theorem for n = 3
    Fermat's Last Theorem for n = 5
    Descartes's rule of signs
    Kepler conjecture for regular arrangements


He also

    explained the pentagramma mirificum (see University of Bielefeld website)
    developed an algorithm for determining the date of Easter
    invented the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm for calculating the discrete Fourier transforms 160 years before Cooley and Tukey

In 1831, Gauss developed a fruitful collaboration with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber,
leading to new knowledge in magnetism (including finding a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, charge, and time) and the discovery of Kirchhoff's circuit laws in electricity.[28] It was during this time that he formulated his namesake law.
They constructed the first electromechanical telegraph in 1833,[64] which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in Göttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic observatory to be built in the garden of the observatory,
and with Weber founded the "Magnetischer Verein" (magnetic association), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer (magnetospheric) sources of Earth's magnetic field.
